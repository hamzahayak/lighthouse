# Lighthouse (Frontend Repository)

Lighthouse is a website where people put cryptocurreny bounties on a lost belonging.

The frontend was built using ReactJS. The backend involves Fortran, Auth0, Courier, Twilio and Google Cloud.

This project was made for [jacobsHack! 2021](https://jacobshack-2021.devpost.com/), a student-run hackathon at Jacobs University in Bremen, Germany. This repository is dedicated for the frontend only. The full project can be found in the hackathon's Devpost [submission](https://devpost.com/software/lighthouse-v4kf5b).

Complimentary repos: [backend](https://github.com/b15h0y/atlnts-backend) and [infrastructure](https://github.com/dorrabbkhan/atlnts-infrastructure).

## The theme and idea

The hackaton's theme was "The Lost city of Atlantis". Lighthouse represents a diving experience in the search of lost items, and Atlantis in the bottom of the ocean!
